Description: Bayesian inference of strong partial orders from noisy observations
    using Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) methods. Implements the
    non-hierarchical case of partial-order models with support for queue-jump
    and Mallows noise models. Includes generic data loading, covariate effects,
    and comprehensive visualization tools.
